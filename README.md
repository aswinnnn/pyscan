A dependency vulnerability scanner for your python projects, straight from the terminal. 

+ blazingly fast and efficient scanner that can be used to scan large projects fairly quickly.
+ automatically uses requirements.txt, pyproject.toml or straight from the source code (though not reccomended)
+ easy to use, and can be integrated into existing build processes.
+ In its very early alpha stage, so some features may not work correctly. PRs welcome.
